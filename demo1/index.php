    <h2>A BRIEF SUMMARY ABOUT ME:</h2>
    <p>Born on 20th of October 2004.</p>
    <p>I live with my mom and my big sister but later on got dogs.</p>
    <p>In 2013 my dad moved to Tanzania and I went to visit him with my big sister. </p>
    <p>I have a baby sister who was born on 27th of August 2014 and we didn't really get along that well. </p>
    <p>In 2016 my dad moved to Uganda and the only time we could visit was during holidays. </p>
    <p>In 2017 my dad moved back to Nairobi which was interesting because it fun to have both parents in the country so I don't keep leaving the country.</p>
